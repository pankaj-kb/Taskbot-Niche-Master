Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy. - Naval Ravikant     
Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you. - Naval Ravikant    
Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. - Naval Ravikant
You’re not going to get rich by renting out your time. You must own equity — a piece of a business — to gain your financial freedom. - Naval Ravikant
You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale. - Naval Ravikant  
Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people. - Naval Ravikant 
The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet. - Naval Ravikant
Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest. - Naval Ravikant
Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity. - Naval Ravikant
Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling. - Naval Ravikant
Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable. - Naval Ravikant
Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage. - Naval Ravikant
Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you. - Naval Ravikant
Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now. - Naval Ravikant
Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others. - Naval Ravikant
When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools. - Naval Ravikant
Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated. - Naval Ravikant
Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage. - Naval Ravikant
The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon. - Naval Ravikant
“Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” -Archimedes - Naval Ravikant
Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal costs of replication (code and media). - Naval Ravikant
Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment. - Naval Ravikant
Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it. - Naval Ravikant
Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you. - Naval Ravikant
Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. - Naval Ravikant
An army of robots is freely available — it’s just packed in data centers for head and space efficiency. Use it. - Naval Ravikant
If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts. - Naval Ravikant
Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment. - Naval Ravikant
Judgment requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills. - Naval Ravikant
There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. - Naval Ravikant
Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers. - Naval Ravikant
Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching. - Naval Ravikant
You should be too busy to “do coffee,” while still keeping an uncluttered calendar. - Naval Ravikant
Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save you less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it. - Naval Ravikant
Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work. - Naval Ravikant
Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true. - Naval Ravikant
There are no get rich quick schemes. That’s just someone else getting rich off you. - Naval Ravikant
Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve. - Naval Ravikant
When you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realize that it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place. But that’s for another day. - Naval Ravikant
It’s “wisdom of markets,” not “wisdom of crowds.” - Naval Ravikant
Criticism without creativity is just pessimism. - Naval Ravikant 
The honest way to critique is to create the alternative. - Naval Ravikant
The good life is the fruit of understanding, freedom from care, and effortless self-discipline. - Naval Ravikant
Take no other monkey’s word for it. - Naval Ravikant
Bitcoin is insurance against politicians. - Naval Ravikant 
Our temporary solution to a temporary problem has become a permanent problem. - Naval Ravikant
